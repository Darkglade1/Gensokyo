    "DESCRIPTIONS": [
      "A thick ~fog~ descends upon you, enveloping you in a ~murky~ shroud. You are tempted to disperse the nuisance with a gust of #rflame, but the ~fog~ lifts just as quickly as it came, leaving you in an ~otherworldly~ place. NL NL You see two women standing near a tree, a ~beautiful~ tree with boughs stretched out like a #ygrand invitation. You see the blond one murmur something to her companion before stepping away, leaving the pink-haired woman alone with the tree.",
      "You find yourself stepping forward, drawn by the overwhelming presence of ~something~ you had long since forgotten. NL NL \"You probably shouldn't come any closer.\" NL NL You couldn't help but notice the #rbitterness in the woman’s voice as you ask her why. NL NL \"I was born a #p~cursed~ child. Born with hands stained #rred by something outside my control, #p~cursed~ with an ability that makes everyone around me perpetually #pfear for their lives.\"",
      "You can ~smell~ it in the air, the stench of #rdeath. You had thought it was coming from the #pyoukai tree, but now you can tell it had been ~emanating~ from the woman all along. NL NL \"No one wants me. No one wants to even ~be~ around me. It would probably be for the best if I just . . . disappeared.\" NL NL You see the slim #rdagger in the other woman’s hands. You see her raise it, its ~trembling,~ silver point pressed ~precariously~ against her chest - ",
      "She ~freezes~ as your voice reaches her, her head ~slowly~ ~swiveling~ towards you like she couldn't believe you had honestly proposed the notion that you would be her friend. NL NL \"You . . . you would #r@abandon@ me before long, just like the others! They always do, once they’re fed up with living in perpetual fear of my ability!\" NL NL You tell her that you are #gimmortal, that you had long since forgotten what it meant to #pfear #pdeath.",
      "She gives you an incredulous look. NL NL ~\"Prove~ ~it!\"~ NL NL She holds out a hand.",
      "You take her hand. NL NL #rSearing #rpain flows through your body, every single one of your cells @screaming@ in #r~agony~ as the essence of #pdeath invaded ~every~ fiber of your being - NL NL The #rpain faded to a dull throb, and you felt your body #grestore itself as the ~world~ corrected the error that was your deceased self. NL NL You see her ~staring~ at you, tears ~trickling~ down her face, ~dumbfounded~ that you were still upright instead of a #pcrumpled #pcorpse.",
      "\"You’re . . . you’re ~still~ #galive!\" NL NL She embraces you, burying her face in your chest as she ~sobbed.~ NL NL You #gcomfort her awkwardly, unused to this kind of ~intimate~ gesture. NL NL You glance up and notice the other woman from before standing there, observing the two of you. NL NL She smiles, ~whispering~ something only you could hear. NL NL #g\"Thank #gyou.\"",
      "#pDespair clouds her face as you stand there, unmoving. NL NL \"You . . . ~you’re~ just like the ~rest~ of them!\" NL NL The dagger rises, glinting ~silver~ in the moonlight. NL NL @\"I@ #r@hate@ @all@ @of@ @you!\"@ NL NL #rBlood sprays across the tree’s trunk.",
      "Her body ~crumples~ to the ground, finally at peace. NL NL It was nothing you haven't seen before. She was simply ~another~ #rvictim in a long line of #ptragedies you had witnessed over the eons. NL NL You would forget about this before long. NL NL You always did."

But if that is not to your liking, I could offer you one of the antique relics we have lying around if you are willing to offer a little . . . donation.\"",

      "\"Thank you very much.\" NL NL You see something streak by your face, something ~silvery~ and ~sharp~ . A flash of #rpain erupts from your cheek, and you smell the metallic tang of #r~blood~ - NL NL You blink. The pain was gone, and a bandage now adorned your face.",
      "You turn to see the maid holding a vial of #rblood. NL NL \"I apologize for any discomfort you may have experienced; I'm usually much more efficient than that.\" NL NL She walks off into a side room and returns with a strange #yrelic in hand.
